                        <p>I am a dedicated game art and animation student at the 
                         University of Advancing Technology, where I maintain a 3.88 GPA and have earned 
                         both Dean’s List and President’s List honors. With expertise in 3D modeling, 
                         animation, and game design I bring a versatile skill set across industry-standard
                         tools such as <b>Maya, 3ds Max, Fusion, Unity, Unreal Engine, and Construct.</b> My work
                        ranges from creating detailed characters and environments to developing fully 
                        playable levels and prototypes.<i>My Military backround has shaped me 
                        into a professional who thrives under pressure, excels at process improvement, conflict 
                        resolution, and time management, and carries forward a strong sense of discipline and 
                        self-motivation. Combined with hands-on experience in both technical and creative 
                        environments.</i> I bring a unique blend of artistic vision, technical proficiency, and 
                        leadership to every project.I am passionate about crafting immersive experiences, pushing
                        the boundaries of interactive storytelling, and contributing to the future of game 
                        development and digital art.</p>
